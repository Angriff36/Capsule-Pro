/**
 * Database Types Export
 *
 * This file exports only types from the Prisma client, making it safe to import
 * from client components without triggering the "server-only" restriction.
 *
 * Import types from here when you need database types in client components:
 * import type { CommandBoard, CommandBoardCard } from "@repo/database/types";
 */
export type * from "./generated/client";
