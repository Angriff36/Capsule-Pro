# Development Notes

## Setup Discipline (Required)

- Follow all relevant setup steps from official docs end-to-end (install, env, scripts, generators, integration).
- No minimal patterns or partial installs; wire into the actual repo files.
- If blocked or missing secrets, stop and ask before proceeding.
