# Sitemap

How we generate the sitemap for the website.

next-forge automatically generates the sitemap for the website using Next.js's built-in sitemap generation functionality (`sitemap.ts`). The generation process scans different directories in the project and creates sitemap entries for various types of content:

## [Page Collection](#page-collection)

The system first scans the `app` directory to collect all page routes:

1. Reads all directories in the `app` folder
2. Filters out:
   * Directories starting with underscore (`_`) which are typically internal/private routes
   * Directories starting with parentheses (`(`) which are usually Next.js route groups
3. Uses the remaining directory names as valid page routes

## [Content Collection](#content-collection)

The system then scans two content directories:

### [Blog Posts](#blog-posts)

* Reads all files in the `content/blog` directory
* Filters out:
  + Directory entries (only wants files)
  + Files starting with underscore
  + Files starting with parentheses
* Removes the `.mdx` extension from filenames

### [Legal Pages](#legal-pages)

* Similarly scans the `content/legal` directory
* Applies the same filtering rules as blog posts
* Removes `.mdx` extensions

## [Sitemap Generation](#sitemap-generation)

The final sitemap is generated by combining all these routes:

1. Adds the base URL as the root entry
2. Adds all page routes prefixed with the base URL
3. Adds all blog posts under the `blog/` path
4. Adds all legal pages under the `legal/` path

Each sitemap entry includes:

* A full URL (combining the base URL with the route)
* A `lastModified` timestamp (set to the current date)

The sitemap is automatically regenerated during each build, ensuring it stays up to date with your content.
