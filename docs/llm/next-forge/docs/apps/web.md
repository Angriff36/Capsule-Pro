# Web

How the website application works in next-forge.

The `web` application runs on port 3001. We recommend deploying it to `www.{yourdomain}.com`.

next-forge comes with a default website application, which is located in the `apps/web` folder.

## [Overview](#overview)

It's built on Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with some example pages scaffolded using [TWBlocks](https://www.twblocks.com/). It's designed for you to customize and extend to your needs, whether that means keeping the default pages or replacing them with your own.
