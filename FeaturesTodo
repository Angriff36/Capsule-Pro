Persist Sales Dashboard Data
1. Confirm requirements (per-user vs shared, raw XLSX vs parsed JSON, replace vs versioning, size limits).
2. Add storage schema: table for dashboard datasets keyed by Clerk user id; fields for blob URL, uploaded_at, source filename, and parsed JSON payload.
3. Implement upload route/server action: validate file type/size, store XLSX in blob storage, parse on server, write DB record.
4. Implement fetch route/server action: load latest dataset for user, return parsed JSON to client; add “Replace data” flow.
5. Update UI: on load, check for stored dataset; allow use without upload; surface status and last updated.
6. Add error handling and guardrails (invalid columns, parse failures, missing data) with clear UI messaging.
7. Manual verification: upload, refresh, cross-device login, replace data, and regression test charts.
