0a. Study `specs/command-board/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the Command Board OS specifications — especially `specs/command-board/boardspec.md` (the master AI-Native Command Board OS spec).
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_commandboard_os.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `apps/app/app/(authenticated)/command-board/*`, `apps/api/app/api/command-board/*`, `apps/api/app/api/ai/*`, and `packages/ai/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand the existing Command Board implementation, AI integration, and shared utilities.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `apps/app/`, `apps/api/`, and `packages/`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_commandboard_os.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `apps/app/app/(authenticated)/command-board/`, `apps/api/app/api/command-board/`, `apps/api/app/api/ai/`, `apps/app/app/lib/command-board/`, and `packages/ai/` and compare it against `specs/command-board/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_commandboard_os.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_commandboard_os.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `packages/` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Transform the Command Board from a canvas-with-cards into an AI-Native Command Board OS — a spatial command surface where users run their entire catering operation via intent-driven AI interaction. The board becomes the canonical projection surface for the entire domain, the primary interaction model, and the AI-mediated control plane. Key deliverables in priority order: (1) Intent-to-Execution Engine — users describe outcomes, system generates Manifest-backed executable plans with preview/approve/execute flow, (2) Risk Intelligence — board continuously evaluates deadline conflicts, overloaded staff, inventory insufficiency, margin erosion with AI-explainable risk nodes, (3) AI as Configuration Abstraction — users express intent in natural language instead of navigating config screens, AI compiles to domain commands/policies/projections, (4) Board as Operational Digital Twin — live projection of events/tasks/inventory/staff/finance with domain-derived edges, (5) Simulation Engine — fork board into ephemeral simulation, run domain commands in preview mode, show cost/labor/task deltas before commitment. All mutations must compile to Manifest domain commands. AI proposes, Manifest enforces, Board projects. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/command-board/SPEC_FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_commandboard_os.md using a subagent.
