# Terminal / Shell Commands (Agents)

When running or suggesting terminal commands in this workspace (Windows):

## Do NOT use NUL redirects

**Never** use `>nul`, `2>nul`, `>nul 2>&1`, or similar redirects to suppress output.

On Windows, these often create **literal files named `nul`** in the current directory instead of redirecting to the null device, cluttering the repo and causing confusion.

❌ **BAD**:
```powershell
pnpm install >nul 2>&1
some-command 2>nul
```

✅ **GOOD**:
- Run the command without redirecting (output is fine in the terminal).
- If you must hide output, use PowerShell: `| Out-Null` only for the last part of a pipeline, and avoid redirecting stderr to nul.
- Prefer not suppressing output unless the user explicitly asks.

This rule applies to all agent-generated or agent-suggested commands.
