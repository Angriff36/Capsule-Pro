0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `packages/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the relevant code for this project lives in `packages/manifest/src`, `packages/manifest/bin`, `apps/api`, and `packages/kitchen-ops` (manifests are in `packages/kitchen-ops/manifests`).

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use Task tool with up to 500 parallel subagents (subagent_type='Explore') to study existing source code in `packages/manifest/src*` and compare it against `"C:\Projects\capsule-pro\specs\manifest-integration_INPROGRESS"`. Use Task tool with subagent_type='Opus' or model='opus' to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete. IMPORTANT: Always use the Task tool for file operations, searches, and analysis - never use Read/Grep directly for exploration work.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `packages/*` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to Deliver a deterministic, production-validated Manifest projection pipeline for Capsule-Pro that compiles domain manifests into type-safe Next.js command handlers, enforces guard/policy/constraint semantics through the runtime bridge, integrates real Clerk auth and tenant resolution, executes successfully against live domain logic without stubs, and maintains regression protection through snapshot, TypeScript, and HTTP-level verification across multiple entities. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
