0a. Study `specs/*` using the Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents) to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `packages/*` and `apps/*` using the Task tool with subagent_type='Explore' (up to 500 parallel Sonnet subagents) to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `apps/*` and `packages/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents (using the Task tool with subagent_type='Explore') to study existing source code and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent (Task tool with subagent_type='Opus') to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `packages/design-system` and other packages as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve Command Board Persistence, Real-time Sync, Visual Relationship Connectors, and Entity Cards (The system stores and retrieves command board layouts per user/tenant including entity positions, zoom levels, and view preferences so users can maintain custom board arrangements across sessions. Multiple users can collaborate on the command board simultaneously; changes made by one user (entity movements, updates, cursor positions) are visible to all other users in real-time without page refresh. The command board displays visual lines or arrows connecting related entities (client to events, events to tasks, tasks to employees), and lines update dynamically as cards are dragged to maintain relationships. The command board displays draggable card components for clients, events, tasks, employees, and inventory; each card shows key status indicators and supports quick actions for efficient workflow.). Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
