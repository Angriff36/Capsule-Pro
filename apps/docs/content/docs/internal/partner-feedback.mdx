# Partner Feedback (Shared)

Purpose: capture partner feedback in one place so product and engineering can track, triage, and follow up.

How to add feedback:
- Add a new entry under "Feedback Log" using the template.
- Keep it short and link to the source (Slack, call notes, email) when possible.
- Avoid PII; redact names/emails/phone numbers unless required.

Template:
```text
- Date:
- Partner:
- Source:
- Summary:
- Pain:
- Requested outcome:
- Priority (P0/P1/P2):
- Area (kitchen/events/scheduling/CRM/other):
- Related docs/links:
- Owner:
- Status (new/triage/in-progress/done):
```

## Add UI Blocks (Simple Steps)
This is the quick, no-fuss way to add a new UI block with Codex.

Browse blocks online:
- https://www.shadcnblocks.com/explorer/blocks
- https://ui.shadcn.com/blocks
- https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-index

Clone the repo and open it:
```bash
git clone <PASTE_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE>
cd capsule-pro
```

Start Codex (pick one):
```bash
# Option A: start Codex from repo root
codex

# Option B: start Codex inside the design system
cd packages/design-system
codex
```

What to ask Codex:
```
Add a new block component in packages/design-system/components/blocks called
<block-name>.tsx and a Storybook story <block-name>.stories.tsx. Use existing
design system UI components. Make sure it appears under “Blocks” in Storybook.
```
