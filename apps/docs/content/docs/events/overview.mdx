# Events Overview

Events are the operational hub for catering work. Each event carries guest counts, dates, locations, and related prep work so kitchen teams and operations stay aligned.

## What an event contains

- Core details: title, event number, date, status, and guest count
- Location and venue metadata
- Linked prep tasks and dishes for kitchen execution
- Source documents (CSV/PDF/image) that generated the event

## Status values

Events support the following statuses:

- draft
- confirmed
- tentative
- cancelled
- completed
- postponed

## How events are created

You can create events in three ways:

1. Manually, from the Events dashboard
2. Importing a CSV (prep list or dish list)
3. Importing a PDF or image (creates a draft event and flags missing fields)

## Where to see events

- Events dashboard: `/events`
- Event detail: `/events/[eventId]`
