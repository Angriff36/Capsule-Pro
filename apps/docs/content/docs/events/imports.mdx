# Event Imports

Event imports attach the source document to the event and generate dishes and prep tasks automatically.

## Supported formats

- CSV (prep list or dish list)
- PDF (placeholder event, source file attached)
- Image (placeholder event, source file attached)

## How to import

1. Open the Events dashboard and click **Import**.
2. Upload a CSV, PDF, or image.
3. Review the created event and linked tasks.

## What gets created from CSV

When a CSV import succeeds, the system creates:

- An event
- Dishes and recipes
- Event dishes
- Prep tasks linked to the event

## CSV formats

The importer detects two common shapes:

### Prep list format

Expected columns:

- `list_id`
- `list_name`
- `item_name`
- `quantity`
- `unit`
- `notes`
- `recipe_name`
- `finish_location`

### Dish list format

Expected columns:

- `Dish Name`
- `Finished At`
- `Servings/Batch`
- `Prep By (if specified)`
- `Quantity/Unit`
- `Special Instructions`

## Source document storage

All imported source files are stored in the database and attached to the event. You can view them inline from the event detail page.
