## Color Theory

- Strong neutrals read modern, high-end, corporate.
- Greens communicate fresh food and quality.
- Spiced orange states creativity and innovation in the food industry; evokes taste.
- Golden zest evokes excellence and quality ingredients; bright, optimistic, friendly tone.

## Typography

- Display: Very Vogue Text + Very Vogue Text Italic (header mix of italic + non-italic, 52pt, 50pt spacing).
- Subheader one: Proxima Nova Regular, ALL CAPS, 50pt spacing.
- Subheader two: bon vivant, 30pt, all lowercase.
- Body: Proxima Nova Light 12pt, black.
- Emphasis callouts: Proxima Nova Italic, usually green.

## Photography

- Greens and oranges should appear in photography.
- Vibrant, high-contrast photo editing.
- Clean, simple backgrounds to let food be the highlight.

## Brand Elements

- Metals: brass and matte black.
- Textures: greenery.
- Hand drawn elements.

## Brand Voice

1. Dates should use six digits with periods: `00.00.00` (avoid dashes or slashes).
2. Spell out “and”; if replacing, use “+” not “&”.
3. Times should be written out `5:00 pm` (avoid `5 PM`, `5pm`, `5:30 PM`).
4. No hyphens within line breaks of body text.

## Todo

- Add font files for: Very Vogue Text (regular + italic), Proxima Nova (regular/light/italic), bon vivant.
- Map Pantone values to exact hex/RGB for the palette and update tokens.
