# Plan: Full Official Manifest Generation — overwrite hand-authored code with IR-driven output

> **Created 2026-06-01.** Branch-isolated initiative. Goal: drive Capsule-Pro's schema, routes,
> stores, types, and validation from Manifest IR via the OFFICIAL `@angriff36/manifest` projections
> + `manifest build`/`generate` CLI, overwriting hand-authored equivalents. Supersedes the stalled
> additive approach (task_plan.md Phase 2b / notes.md §14).
>
> **DOCS-FIRST IS MANDATORY (see manifest/AGENTS.md top + tasks/lessons.md Lesson 10).** Every phase
> begins by WebFetching the relevant https://manifest-b1e8623f.mintlify.app/ page. Do not reason from
> dist/*.js or greps alone. If unsure whether the official method exists, fetch the doc — it does.

## ★ FIRST PRINCIPLE — Manifest is the source of truth (do not violate this)
The `.manifest` source files define what entities/commands/relations/policies SHOULD be. The Prisma
projection GENERATES whatever the database needs FROM that source. The database schema is downstream
OUTPUT, never a target to reproduce.

- The current 226 hand-authored Prisma models / live DB are **LEGACY**. They are REFERENCE-ONLY — used
  solely to spot intent that isn't yet expressed in `.manifest` source. They are NOT a parity target.
- When the generated schema is "missing" something, the fix is ALWAYS to **rewrite/add to the
  `.manifest` files** to express that intent, then regenerate. NEVER reconcile the IR backwards to
  match existing table/column names, and NEVER pair entities to current tables to preserve them.
- Dev data + the current schema are expendable. We regenerate and reset; we do not protect them.
If you find yourself trying to make generated output "match the existing 226 models," STOP — that is
the rejected backwards approach.

## Goal (success state)
`manifest build` (config-driven) regenerates the full Prisma schema, all CRUD routes, types/client,
and validation FROM the `.manifest` source — and the app compiles, validates, and runs on that
generated output, with hand-authored schema/stores/routes RETIRED. No remote push until proven.

## The real shape of the work (corrected — not what prior notes implied)
The classifier buckets the 226 live models as: **A=16** durable→projected today; **B=78** real Manifest
entities with FULL `.manifest` source, just classified `store … in memory` (73 already have a `create`
command); **C=14** real entities missing only a `store` line; **D=118** legacy child/junction/integration
tables (audit_log, task_claims, NowstaConfig, …) with no IR entity.

**So the gap is STORE CLASSIFICATION, not missing source.** 92 entities (B+C) are essentially one
`store … in durable` line away from projecting. The heavy "model every entity from scratch" fear in
prior notes (§14) was wrong for the bulk of them — their source already exists.

The one real authoring task is RELATIONS. The earlier emit stayed additive because, e.g., Event
(durable) → EventBudget relation was DROPPED since EventBudget was memory; the projection only emits a
relation when BOTH sides are durable. Flipping has **cluster effects**: making an entity durable can
require modeling the back-relation on each durable neighbor. That back-relation modeling is just
AUTHORING INTENT IN `.manifest` source (the right thing) — not reconciling to the old DB. Flip clusters
together (e.g. the whole Event cluster), add the relations both sides in source, regenerate.

D (118 legacy tables) are NOT a goal to preserve. If any represents real domain intent, that intent
gets authored as a proper `.manifest` entity; otherwise it's legacy to be dropped. Do not model the IR
around keeping them.

## Official tooling to ADOPT (doc-confirmed; we currently reinvent these)
- `manifest build [src]` — compile+generate in one step, config-driven (the official path).
- `manifest generate <ir> -p prisma -s prisma.schema -o <dir>` — Prisma schema projection
  (integration/prisma): full durable models, relations, `tableMappings`/`columnMappings`/`precision`/
  `foreignKeys`/`fieldAttributes`, `provider` → also emits `prisma.config.ts`.
- `manifest generate <ir> -p nextjs` — routes (+ `--surface types|client` for types/SDK).
- `manifest doctor` / `audit-governance` / `enforce-surface` / `audit-routes` / `scan` /
  `emit registries` — official governance+drift tooling. Capsule has custom `audit-*` scripts that
  likely duplicate these; evaluate replacing them.
- `manifest.config.yaml` is read by `manifest build` (NOT by our current `manifest generate` flag path).

## Known constraints from the docs (do not relearn the hard way)
- Prisma projection: durable-only; `number`→error (use `money`/`decimal`/`int`/`float`); columns are
  camelCase unless `columnMappings` adds `@map`; relations need BOTH sides modeled in IR; `@@schema`
  multi-schema + composite `@@id` are NOT projection-native (Capsule post-process or IR `key[...]`).
- nextjs projection: `output` is a SINGLE flat dir — `appDir/<entity-lowercased>/`. NO per-entity
  domain tree (no config for `kitchen/recipes`). Our `generate.mjs` remap exists ONLY for this, and
  the frontend has 95+ hardcoded `/api/<domain>/` URLs → domain tree is load-bearing. DECISION NEEDED:
  keep the remap wrapper, OR move frontend to flat entity URLs, OR add compat shims.

## Phases (each starts with a WebFetch of the relevant doc)
- [ ] **Phase 0 — Branch + baseline.** New branch. Snapshot current generate output (routes drift
      harness), `prisma validate` on current schema, full typecheck. Record baseline in notes.
- [ ] **Phase 1 — Adopt config-driven generation.** WebFetch /cli/configuration. Write a CORRECT,
      COMPLETE `manifest.config.yaml` (nextjs + prisma projection blocks, all real options). Decide
      `manifest build` vs keep `generate.mjs` wrapper for domain routing. Prove identical route output.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — Store classification + types (the bulk of the gap).** WebFetch /language/*. For the
      B (78) + C (14) entities whose `.manifest` source already exists: set/flip `store … in durable`,
      and fix `number` props → money/decimal/int/float (projection errors on bare number). This alone
      moves ~92 entities into projection. Recompile; `manifest:try-prisma` per entity until no
      PRISMA_SKIPPED/AMBIGUOUS diagnostics. NOT reconciling to old columns — just declaring durable +
      correct types in source.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — Relations, authored in source (cluster by cluster).** WebFetch /integration/prisma
      relations section. Where the projection drops a relation because the target was memory, the fix
      is to author BOTH sides of the relation in `.manifest` source and flip the cluster durable
      together (e.g. Event + EventBudget + EventGuest + … ). Add any genuinely-needed back-relations as
      INTENT in source. This is authoring what the domain SHOULD be, not matching the old DB.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — Generate the schema FROM source → make it live.** WebFetch /integration/prisma.
      Run the Prisma projection (`manifest generate -p prisma` / `manifest build`) to emit the schema
      from IR. Supply only the projection options that express INTENT (provider, precision, intentional
      @map/@@map physical names, @@schema/composite-key post-process). The generated schema is the new
      truth — do NOT diff-to-match the legacy 226 models; only consult them to catch missing intent to
      add to SOURCE. `prisma validate` GREEN on generated output → `prisma generate` → reset/recreate
      dev DB from it (data expendable).
- [ ] **Phase 5 — Routes + stores from IR.** Generate all CRUD routes; wire stores so every durable
      entity persists to its generated table (kill the JSON-blob fallbacks). Retire hand-written
      routes/stores per phase-out-registry.md, replacement proven first. D (118 legacy tables): drop
      unless the underlying intent has been authored as a proper `.manifest` entity.
- [ ] **Phase 6 — Replace custom audits with official CLI.** WebFetch /cli/overview. Evaluate
      `manifest doctor`/`audit-governance`/`enforce-surface` vs our custom `audit-*` scripts; adopt
      official where it covers our needs. Add drift gates (generated == committed) to CI.
- [ ] **Phase 7 — Fix downstream.** The hand-written raw-SQL routes (e.g. facilities/work-orders
      `work_order_type` 500) get replaced by generated routes against the generated schema — the whole
      column-drift bug class disappears. Verify app boots + key flows.

## Hard rules
- DOCS FIRST every phase. No push. Dev DB resettable. One retirement per commit, replacement proven.
- Never hand-edit a "Generated from Manifest IR - DO NOT EDIT" file — fix the producer/IR + regen.
- Migrations only via `pnpm db:dev --create-only` (CLAUDE.md DB rules).

## Status
**Phase 0 — not started.** On branch `manifest/full-official-generation` (created 2026-06-01).
Plan corrected 2026-06-01 after user correction: the gap is STORE CLASSIFICATION (B=78 memory + C=14
no-store entities already have full `.manifest` source — 92 entities one `store … durable` line from
projecting), NOT missing source. Manifest source is the source of truth; the 226 legacy models are
reference-only, never a parity target. Fix gaps by authoring `.manifest` source + regenerating, never
by reconciling IR to existing tables. (Reverses the parity framing this file shipped with.)

## Decisions / open questions
1. Domain route tree (95+ frontend URLs) vs flat entity URLs — keep wrapper, migrate FE, or shims?
2. `manifest build` wholesale vs `generate.mjs` wrapper retained for domain remap only.
3. Per-entity bespoke stores vs the generic IR-driven store for the 37 blob entities.
4. Replace custom `audit-*` scripts with official `manifest doctor`/`audit-governance`?
