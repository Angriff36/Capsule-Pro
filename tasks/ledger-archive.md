# Agent 1 (Example)

**Agent ID:** 1
**Date/Time:** EXAMPLE
**Base branch/commit:** EXAMPLE

**Goal:**
Demonstrate how to correctly fill out a ledger entry.

**Invariants enforced:**

- Tests are used to expose real failures, not to go green.
- "Pre-existing" requires action, not dismissal.

**Subagents used:**

- Reproducer agent: illustrates what a minimal failing test would be.
- Tracing agent: illustrates how a root cause would be identified.

**Reproducer:**
EXAMPLE: `path/to/minimal-reproducer.test.ts`

**Root cause:**
EXAMPLE: An invariant is violated at a system boundary due to an unguarded assumption.

**Fix strategy:**
EXAMPLE: Fix the violation at the boundary, not downstream symptoms. Minimal scope.

**Verification evidence:**
EXAMPLE:

```
pnpm test <target>
pnpm build <affected>
```

**Follow-ups filed:**
None (example entry).

**Points tally:**
0 — instructional entry only.
