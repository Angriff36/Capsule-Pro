## Completed Tasks
- [x] T018 Document Location table + fix types - 2026-01-30

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Location table is THE ONE table with proper FK to platform.accounts - this is the reference pattern for all tenant tables
- Location has TWO relationships to Event: locationId (prep location) and venueId (service location)
- No `any` types found in location-related code during this task
- Documentation follows the comprehensive template with frontmatter, columns, relations, queries, and usage examples
- File uses proper click-to-navigate links for cross-references

## Next
Task T019: Document OutboxEvent table (already complete per tasks.md)
