## Completed Tasks
- [x] T022 Document Event table + fix types

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Event table has 3 venue-related columns: location_id (DEPRECATED), venue_id (PREFERRED), venue_name/venue_address (free text)
- Critical confusion documented: location_id should not be used for new code
- No `any` types found in event-related actions.ts, event-form.tsx
- EventGuest table missing foreign key constraint to Event (migration TODO added)
- Event table has rich relations to Client, Location (x2), Budget, BattleBoard, CommandBoard, etc.

## Next
Task T023 or next in sequence
