### T015: audit_log Documentation
- audit_log is in `platform` schema (not tenant-scoped)
- Partitioned table by `created_at` (monthly partitions)
- Uses composite primary key: `(id, created_at)` for partitioning support
- ActionType enum: insert, update, delete
- No RLS policies currently defined (marked as TODO)
- Related to audit_archive (cold storage)
- No direct application usage of audit_log found - only cycleCountAuditLog (different table in tenant_inventory schema)
- Prisma validation shows existing type errors in schema (17 validation errors) but NOT related to audit_log

### Partition Structure
- audit_log uses monthly partitions for efficient lifecycle management
- Partitions named: audit_log_YYYY_MM (e.g., audit_log_2025_01, audit_log_2025_02)
- Hot storage: 90 days in audit_log
- Cold storage: 7 years in audit_archive

### Type Findings
- No `any` type issues found related to audit_log
- Generated Prisma types are correct
- Application code uses `cycleCountAuditLog` (tenant_inventory schema), not `audit_log` (platform schema)
