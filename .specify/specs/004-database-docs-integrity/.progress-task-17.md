## Completed Tasks
- [x] 0.17 Document sent_emails table + fix types - TASK_COMPLETE

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- sent_emails table exists in schema but not yet used in codebase
- Table structure is clean with proper types (UUID, Timestamptz)
- Found that tenant_id is required on platform.sent_emails (unusual for platform schema)
- Type consistency verified: All Prisma types match PostgreSQL schema
- No nullability issues found
- Critical TODO: RLS policy needed for tenant isolation (security issue)
- Missing email tracking wrapper - emails not being logged yet
- correlation_id is free-form string (not validated) - application convention only

## Next
Task T018 or next pending task in sequence
