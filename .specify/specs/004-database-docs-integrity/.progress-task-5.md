## Completed Tasks
- [x] T005: Document core schema - COMMIT_PENDING

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Core schema contains 12 enums (ActionType, EmploymentType, UnitSystem, UnitType, KitchenTaskPriority, KitchenTaskStatus, OutboxStatus, UserRole, ShipmentStatus, admin_action, admin_entity_type, admin_role)
- Core schema contains 6 tables (units, unit_conversions, status_types, status_transitions, waste_reasons, audit_config)
- status_types table enables flexible workflows without code changes - key architectural decision
- All enums are in core schema except admin_* enums which are in tenant_admin schema
- WasteReason model is in core schema (waste_reasons table)

## Next
