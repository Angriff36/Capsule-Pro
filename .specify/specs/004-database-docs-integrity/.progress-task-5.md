# Progress: Database Documentation Integrity

## Completed Tasks
- [x] T005: Document core schema - COMMIT_PENDING
- [x] T006: Document tenant schema - COMMIT_PENDING

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Core schema contains 12 enums (ActionType, EmploymentType, UnitSystem, UnitType, KitchenTaskPriority, KitchenTaskStatus, OutboxStatus, UserRole, ShipmentStatus, admin_action, admin_entity_type, admin_role)
- Core schema contains 6 tables (units, unit_conversions, status_types, status_transitions, waste_reasons, audit_config)
- status_types table enables flexible workflows without code changes - key architectural decision
- All enums are in core schema except admin_* enums which are in tenant_admin schema
- WasteReason model is in core schema (waste_reasons table)
- **T006: Tenant schema has 4 tables: Location, settings, documents, OutboxEvent**
- **CRITICAL FINDING: Only Location has proper FK to Account, other 3 tables MISSING FKs**
- **OutboxEvent uses camelCase (tenantId) instead of snake_case (tenant_id) - NAMING INCONSISTENCY**
- **Location is referenced by both location_id and venue_id on Event table - CONFUSING**
- Outbox pattern used for reliable real-time event publishing to Ably
- Documents table stores parsed PDF/CSV data for event imports
- Settings table is key-value store for tenant configuration (JSON values)

## Next
Continue with T007-T010 (remaining schema documentation tasks in parallel group 1)

## Task Execution Notes
**T005 (Document core schema)**:
- Created comprehensive 520-line documentation file
- Documented all 12 enums with values and usage
- Documented all 6 core tables with columns, constraints, and examples
- Included all required sections: Purpose, Goals, Rules, Decisions, Relations, Lifecycle, Performance, TODOs
- Explained status_types table design decision for flexible workflows
- Documented that enums are immutable once deployed
- Included performance considerations for each component

**T006 (Document tenant schema)**:
- Created comprehensive 450-line documentation file
- Documented all 4 tenant tables with full column details
- **CLEARLY CALLED OUT FK ISSUES: Only Location has FK, 3 tables missing FKs**
- **DOCUMENTED camelCase inconsistency in OutboxEvent (tenantId vs tenant_id)**
- Included all required sections with detailed business rules
- Documented outbox pattern flow and benefits
- Added migration SQL snippets for FK fixes
- Included Known Issues section with all 3 documented problems
- Documented Location as the reference pattern (shows correct FK usage)
