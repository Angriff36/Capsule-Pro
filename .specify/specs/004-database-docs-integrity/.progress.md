## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Platform schema tables have NO tenant_id (exist above tenant isolation)
- Account.id is the central reference for all 84+ tenant tables
- Audit logs use partitioned table strategy (monthly partitions)
- RLS policies missing on audit_log, audit_archive, sent_emails (security issue)
- audit_archive uses cold storage pattern for old audit records
