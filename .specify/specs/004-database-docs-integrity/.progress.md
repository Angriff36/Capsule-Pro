# Progress: Database Documentation and Integrity Fixes

Feature ID: 004
Started: 2025-01-29

## Completed Tasks
- [x] T001: Create directory structure and base files (iteration 1)
  - Created 11 directories and files
  - Established living docs philosophy in README
  - Documented 4 known FK issues in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- [x] T002: Create schema and table documentation templates (iteration 1)
  - Created schema-doc-template.md (6.0K) with 9 required sections
  - Created table-doc-template.md (7.6K) with 10 required sections
  - Templates include frontmatter, linking examples, TODO templates
- [x] T003: Create migrations README and index (iteration 1)
  - Created migrations README with 14 documented migrations
  - Created migration-doc-template.md with 12 sections
  - Documented migration patterns, naming conventions, rollback strategies
- [x] T004: Document platform schema (iteration 1)
  - Created 00-platform.md (918 lines) documenting all 5 platform tables
  - Documented partitioned audit log architecture and decisions
  - Added 3 RLS policy migration TODOs (audit_log, audit_archive, sent_emails)
  - Documented Account as central tenant model referenced by 84+ tables
  - Identified audit archival pattern and retention policies
- [x] T005: Document core schema (iteration 1)
  - Created 01-core.md (520 lines) documenting 12 enums and 6 reference tables
  - Documented status_types table enables flexible workflows without code changes
  - All core enums are immutable once deployed
  - WasteReason model in core schema (cross-module waste tracking)
- [x] T014: Document Tenant table + fix types (iteration 1)
  - Created Tenant.md (288 lines) documenting lightweight tenant registry
  - Documented separation from Account table (technical vs business entity)
  - Documented no FK to Account (application-level sync via slug)
  - Found 0 `any` types in tenant resolution code (already well-typed)
  - Files checked: tenant.ts (database package), tenant.ts (apps)

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Platform schema tables have NO tenant_id (exist above tenant isolation)
- Account.id is the central reference for all 84+ tenant tables
- Audit logs use partitioned table strategy (monthly partitions)
- RLS policies missing on audit_log, audit_archive, sent_emails (security issue)
- audit_archive uses cold storage pattern for old audit records
- Tenant table is lightweight registry separate from Account (no FK between them)
- Tenant resolution code already well-typed with proper TypeScript types
