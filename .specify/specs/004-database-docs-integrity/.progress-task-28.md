## Completed Tasks
- [x] T028 Document event_budget_tracking migration

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- Migration `20260124120000_event_budget_tracking` adds comprehensive budget tracking system
- Three new tables: event_budgets, budget_line_items, budget_alerts
- budget_alerts located in tenant_staff schema (not tenant_events) for broader accessibility
- Added venue_id column to events table for venue association
- All tables use composite primary keys (tenant_id, id) for multi-tenancy
- RLS policies follow standard pattern: select/insert/update enabled, delete disabled (soft deletes only)
- Replica identity FULL configured on all tables for real-time replication support
- Foreign key cascade chain: event → budgets → line items → alerts

## Next
