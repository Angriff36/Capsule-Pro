# Progress: Recipes & Menu Overhaul

Feature ID: 002
Constitution: 1.0.0

## Completed Tasks

- [x] T001 Create recipe-edit-modal component shell - 336bc67d8
- [x] T002 Create shared UI components (skeleton, stars, time badges) - 6ca5b59bc
- [x] T003 Quality checkpoint - Phase 1 Setup - verified

## Current Task

Phase 1 Setup complete. Ready for Phase 2: Recipe Editing (Core POC).

## Learnings

- Sheet component in design-system uses Dialog primitive from radix-ui
- createRecipe action expects: name, category, description, tags, yieldQuantity, yieldUnit, yieldDescription, prepTimeMinutes, cookTimeMinutes, restTimeMinutes, difficultyLevel
- Pre-existing tsconfig issue: declarationMap without declaration/composite option - infrastructure debt, not blocking
- Components export: SkeletonCard, SkeletonCardGrid, DifficultyStars, DifficultyRating, TimeBadges, TotalTimeBadge
- Pre-existing lint errors in apps/api and vitest.config.ts do not affect recipe components

### Verification: T003 [VERIFY] Quality checkpoint - Phase 1 Setup
- Status: PASS
- Fixed lint issues in recipe-edit-modal.tsx:
  - Extracted TagChip and TimeInput helper components to reduce cognitive complexity (16->11)
  - Added block statement to early return (lint/style/useBlockStatements)
  - Moved ternary expressions to computed variables
- Commands: biome check on components directory passed (0 errors)
- TypeScript: Pre-existing TS5069 error in tsconfig.json (declarationMap) unrelated to new code
- All 4 new component files exist and are lint-clean

## Technical Debt Tracking

| Debt | Future Fix | Tracking |
|------|------------|----------|
| Raw SQL in actions.ts | Use Prisma CRUD | Plan.md |
| No Zod validation | Add schema validation | Phase 3+ |
| No optimistic updates | Add for drag-drop | Future |
