## Task T017: Improve Empty States

### Completed
Enhanced empty states across all tabs (Recipes, Dishes, Menus, Ingredients, Costing Analysis):

**Improvements Made:**
1. **Enhanced Iconography**: Replaced generic icons with specific, meaningful lucide icons
   - Recipes: ChefHatIcon (kept)
   - Dishes: Changed from BookOpenIcon → UtensilsIcon (more specific)
   - Ingredients: Changed from ChefHatIcon → PackageIcon (unique identifier)
   - Menus: Changed from BookOpenIcon → ClipboardListIcon (menu-specific)
   - Costing: Changed from BookOpenIcon → TrendingUpIcon (profitability theme)

2. **Improved CTAs**: Made all call-to-action buttons more descriptive and actionable
   - Recipes: "Add Recipe" → "Create New Recipe" 
   - Dishes: "Add Dish" → "Create New Dish"
   - Ingredients: Added missing CTA → "Add Ingredient"
   - Menus: Added CTA → "Browse Recipes & Dishes"
   - Costing: "Add dish" → "Add Your First Dish"

3. **Better Descriptions**: Enhanced empty state copy with more context
   - More descriptive and user-friendly language
   - Clearer value propositions
   - Better explanation of features and benefits

4. **Consistent Styling**: Ensured all empty states follow the same pattern
   - All use `Empty` component with `bg-card/50` class
   - All have proper icon, title, description, and CTA structure
   - Consistent spacing and alignment

5. **Added Ingredient Support**: Extended primaryAction to include ingredients tab
