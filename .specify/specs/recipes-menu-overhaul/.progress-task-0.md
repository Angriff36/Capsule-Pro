Feature ID: 002
Task: T001 - Create recipe-edit-modal component shell

## Completed Tasks

- [x] T001 Create recipe-edit-modal component shell - 336bc67d8

## Learnings

- Sheet component in design-system uses Dialog primitive from radix-ui
- createRecipe action expects: name, category, description, tags, yieldQuantity, yieldUnit, yieldDescription, prepTimeMinutes, cookTimeMinutes, restTimeMinutes, difficultyLevel
- Pre-existing tsconfig issue: declarationMap without declaration/composite option - this is infrastructure debt, not blocking
- Build passes successfully with new component
