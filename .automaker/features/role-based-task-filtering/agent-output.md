I'll implement the role-based task filtering feature for the kitchen tasks. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the existing structure.

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Input: {
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Explore existing kitchen task queries and user role structure",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "activeForm": "Exploring codebase structure"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement role-based filtering logic for kitchen tasks",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Implementing role-based filtering"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create Playwright verification test",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Creating verification test"
    },
    {
      "content": "Run verification and clean up test",
      "status": "pending",
      "activeForm": "Running verification test"
    }
  ]
}
