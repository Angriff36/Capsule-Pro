Convoy is a multi-tenant catering operations platform built around a full-screen “Strategic Command Board.” Instead of traditional CRM/TPP list views, the primary UI is a drag-and-drop, real-time dashboard that visually maps how work relates across the business—clients, events, tasks, employees, schedules, inventory, and profitability—so users can run operations from one high-agency board with clear ownership, status, and next actions.

AI reduces the administrative burden by automating heavy UI work (bulk combining/grouping, bulk edits, task generation, conflict detection, summaries, and suggested next steps), while humans remain in control through direct manipulation of the command board. The goal is to remove the barrier-to-entry of traditional enterprise systems while keeping the system operationally precise.

The platform uses shared canonical entities across all modules (CRM, Events, Kitchen Ops, Scheduling, Payroll, Inventory, Reporting) so the same task/employee/event/client appears consistently everywhere. Modules must remain loosely coupled and independently usable (e.g., CRM-only without Kitchen, Scheduling-only without Inventory), while still interoperating cleanly when enabled together.

Tenant isolation is non-negotiable and enforced end-to-end (strict tenant_id patterns, RLS alignment, role-based access, auditing, soft-delete recovery). Real-time updates and collaboration power operational boards (including kanban workflows, task claiming, progress states, leadership/war-room views), and background processing should follow a reliable outbox/event publishing pattern. Documentation is treated as a product feature via living MDX docs (Fumadocs) maintained alongside the codebase.
