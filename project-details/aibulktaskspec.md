What the spec actually is (this matters)

A per-task spec is not a PRD, and it is not an implementation plan.

It should answer only:

What exists when this is done

What must be true

What must not happen

That’s it.

For example, a good spec for AI Bulk Task Generation might say:

Given an event with menu items, staff, timing, and location, the system can generate kitchen prep, setup, and follow-up tasks that:

Are grouped by station

Have explicit due times

Never overwrite existing manual tasks

Can be accepted, edited, or rejected by a human before activation

No code. No libraries. No “use Prisma.”
Just behavioral gravity.
